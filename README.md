# TuringMachine
This is an implementation of the Turing Machine algorithm in Java. Takes in a user input 
test word and a file (currently configured to accept .tm files), and tests to see if the word is accepted
with the language. 


Test cases are included, so when compiled, a user can just give the relative path of the included cases.
